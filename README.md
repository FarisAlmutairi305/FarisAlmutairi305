### About Me
I'm passionate about building secure, reliable IT infrastructure with a strong focus on PKI, certificates, and automation. I work extensively with EJBCA Community Edition to design and manage enterprise certificate services, automate certificate lifecycles, and support large-scale internal environments.

I enjoy working across both Linux and Windows Server, hardening systems, and enforcing strong security policies. I also use NGINX as a reverse proxy to securely expose internal applications, strengthen TLS configurations, and ensure consistent certificate trust across the organization.

My goal is to create stable, scalable, and security-driven environments that simplify certificate management and improve overall infrastructure resilience.
